## ðŸ“š Teaching

As a Assistant Professor, I help students in courses such as:

- **Communication Electronics**  
- **Circuit Theory**  
- **Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Receivers**

As an Associate Professor, I lead lectures and laboratory sessions, guiding students through both theoretical foundations and practical applications. My teaching integrates hands-on use of advanced software tools such as GNU Radio and ADS, enabling students to gain experience in simulation, design, and experimental validation of communication systems.
